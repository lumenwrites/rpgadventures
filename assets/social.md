# Before session
@everyone We begin in 10 minutes and we have some spots open. If you're free - come join us!

We'll try to make a short, lighthearted, low-combat, system-agnostic, fantasy one-shot adventure. It usually takes around 1-2 hours, give or take.

This is the google doc we'll be filling in with ideas, open it before we begin:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Utc4jnEYwvkQLWMcNV9jfbGev8dlBjsJpbdEXrZASoM/
In the google doc go to Tools > Preferences, and uncheck "Automatically Detect Lists", otherwise google docs autoformatting will be really annoying. Feel free to start filling in the first section with the ideas before we begin the session.

If you haven't read the guidelines yet - check them out:

I also recommend to open a note-taking app, can be convenient. And you can open the writing prompts generator (https://playmirage.io/prompts), if you feel like it'll be useful to you.







[Online][Other] Novice GM looking for 2-4 friendly people to help me playtest my new adventure. Lighthearted/Spooky RP-focused one-shot, over voice chat, today, at 8 AM GMT.

Hi! I'm a novice GM, I have made a new one-shot adventure, and I'm looking for 2-4 friendly people to help me playtest it.

We'll be playing [Mirage](https://playmirage.io) - a lighthearted, low-combat, rules-light, storytelling/improv-focused roleplaying game. It's like DnD, but focused on social/creative aspects, without all the math, intricate rules, and the slow combat encounters.

It takes 10-20 minites to prepare for the game. All you need to start playing is the basic understanding of the [rules](https://playmirage.io/rules), and a character sheet (you can use a premade one, or I can help you make a new one).

If that sounds interesting - send me a message(`lumen#7925` on Discord).

Novice players are welcome!




Once we have 3-4 players, we'll decide when it's convenient for everyone to start playing.
