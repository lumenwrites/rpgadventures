Notes
  But what if the [Role] was slowly turning into {a} [Animal]?
  Look, we don't really care about the plot. Just add a bunch of sweet hip-hop dance-offs.
  What if the [Role] got eaten by {a} [Animal]...in the middle of a big speech!
  Can we give the [Role] a split personality? That never gets old!
  We need to get those Twilight fans. Let's add a supernatural love triangle! Use {a} [Creature].
  What if the [Role]'s {right|left} {hand|foot|eye|brain} was possessed by {the Devil|[PubFig]}? Also, make them {a} {stoner|[Profession]}.
  What if the main characters were all school {boys|girls} from [Country] on a class trip?
  Maybe this needs a bunch of [Align] [Creature]s?
  What if the [Role.selectUnique(2).joinItems(" and the ")] both have moms named Martha?
  What if every character died by the end of the movie... Every character.
  Needs to be more "woke." Which is either something to do with social justice or insomnia awareness; we aren't sure, so let's do both.
  [Idea] But what if we actually split this movie into three movies. What would part {one|two|three|four} look like?
  [Idea] But can we add one more human [Animal]?
  Do you think we can replace every conflict with a dance-off?
  Soooo... We only have a ${10-500} special effects budget. How can you make that work?
  Needs more woodland critters.
  Can we make the [Role] more endearingly clumsy?
  Can we do {half|{1-2}/3|{1|3}/4|{1-4}/5|{1|5}/6|{1-6}/7|{1|3|5|7}/8|{1|2|4|5|7|8}/9|{1|3|7|9}/10|{1-10}/11|{1|5|7|11}/12|{1-99}%} of this movie in {claymation|animation|computer animation|black and white|[Country]}?
  We don't just want a happy ending. We want a sappy ending. Make it happen! Or should I say, make it sappen!
  What if this were {a} [Genre] film? Those are hip now, right?
  What if this whole story took place at {a} [Business]?
  I've got to be honest with you. I don't think there are enough {[Animal]s|[Creature]s|[Profession]s} in this movie.
  Let's try setting this in {a} [Business] from the future.
  Honestly, we're making this for late-night tv. We just want this movie to put people to sleep.
  What if the monster was played by a hand puppet? There is a monster, right?
  How can we make a {tank|box|cage|house|trailer|swimming pool|[Business]} full of [Animal]s central to the final fight?
  What if the [Role] was a robot that could transform into a car?
  What if all the characters are lost in a dangerous {cave|jungle|forest}?
  Good news: [PubFig] is willing to play themselves in this film.
  What if the main characters have to rescue a kidnapped {prince|princess|king|queen|[Creature]}?
  What if all the characters worked in the circus?
  What if all of the characters were trapped by a blizzard?
  No time for drama. Get straight to the [Scene]s!
  What if all the characters were secretly {worshipping |consorting with |turning into |}[Creature]s?
  But how can we make this appeal to {Trump|Obama|Clinton|Bush|Reagan|marijuana|assisted suicide|{First|Second|Third|Fourth|Fifth|Sixth|Seventh|Eighth|Ninth|Tenth} Amendment} supporters?
  What if this was actually a kid-friendly spin-off to ___? (Choose another previously pitched movie.)
  Let's make all of the characters {grade school-aged|teenaged|young adult|middle aged|senior citizen} {white|black|Hispanic|Canadian|Latino|Caucasian|African-American|Chinese|Japanese|Korean|Mexican|Russian|German|French|British|Scottish|Welsh|American} {males|females}. That's an underserved demographic.
  Let's make this a hip-hop musical just like Hamilton! Everyone loves Hamilton!
  [Idea] Let's set this whole thing on the international space station.
  What if this was the secret true story of {the Loch Ness monster|Bigfoot|chupacabra|[PubFig]}?
  What if the [Role] is literally a fish out of water? Like in those Nemo movies.
  We need to keep this movie rated {G|PG|PG-13|R|NC-17}. Is that going to be a problem?
  Who would you have voice the talking [a=Animal.selectOne.evaluateItem]? Also, add a talking [a].
  What if the [Role] was {a} [c=Creature.selectOne.evaluateItem]... But they didn't know they were {a} [c]!
  Love it. But what if we add some crazy slapstick comedy?
  The [Role]'s backstory needs some work. Can we blame it on {science|magic|technology|the {Republicans|Democrats}|[PubFig]}?
  Let's set this on {the moon|Mars|Mercury|Pluto|Neptune|Uranus|Jupiter|Saturn|Venus}!
  What if the whole plot were centered around {a} [Sport] competition?
  How can we change the theme of the movie to be "love {heals|causes} all wounds?"
  Can this be a retelling of {Romeo and Juliet|Hamlet|Macbeth|A Midsummer Night's Dream}? People love those!
  This really needs to end with a wedding. Everyone loves weddings!
  You know what's hot right now? Teen pregnancy. Can we work one of those in somehow?
  Add some [Creature.selectUnique(2).joinItems("s and {fire|ice|lightning|water|earth|air|acid|poison} ")]s. People go crazy for that stuff!
  What if the [Role] dressed up like {a} [Animal] to fight crime?
  Let's add some [Creature]s.
  What if all the characters were in {{grade|middle|high} school|college|prison|the hospital|[City]|[Country]|[State]}?
  The writers are on strike. So we're going to need to make this a low-budget sing-along. Cool?
  I think this could really use {a} [Creature] invasion in Act Three.
  How can we make this the next big {pirate|robot|zombie|vampire|wizard} franchise?
  What if the [Role] had a nuclear bomb strapped to them? That would be more exciting, right?
  Can we make this whole story take place in one room? We don't have any money to spend on locations.
  Great, but what if the whole thing was set on {a} {airplane|blimp|zeppelin|submarine|train|space ship|elevator}?
  Add more dads; we want this to be the perfect Father's Day movie.
  Add more moms; we want this to be the perfect Mother's Day movie.
  The characters need more superpowers. Also, let's make the superpowers more realistic.
  What if we set this during the [Time] instead?
  What if the [Role] could talk to {animals|[Animal]s}? But has to keep it a secret!
  Let's add some {happy|angry|sad|annoying|singing|{red|orange|yellow|green|blue|indigo|violet|pink|sparkly}} [a=Animal.selectOne.evaluateItem]s. Kids love [a]s!
  Let's add some cancer, but don't make it a big deal. We don't want this to be a downer.
  We want to stay with the trends, so can you make this movie be sort of a cross between ___ and ___ ? (Choose two previously pitched movies.)
  But what if the [Role] was actually a very {sorry|happy|angry|confused} [PubFig]?
  The [Role] needs to be an all-American hero. {He|She} has good looks, makes friends, and also maybe is {a} [Creature].
  What if the [Role] was obsessed with {[Sport]|(choose a hobby)}? That would be quirky, right?
  Can we make all the characters do the time warp again? But in a way that won't get us sued.
  I think we need to start with a more {tragic|epic|upbeat|complicated|confusing|simple|realistic} origin story.
  Can you add {a} [Align] {bed|chair|couch|microwave|kitchen|bathroom|toilet|bathtub} that eats people? No one expects that!
  [Idea] But what if the monster lays eggs in Madison Square Garden. How do the heroes deal with that?
  But what if this were set in a dystopian future where kids fight to the death on a reality tv show?
  This doesn't feel "dope" enough. How can we add more "urban culture?"
  Let's make this a WW{I|II|III|IV} movie.
  Add {a} [Animal] and have it get killed. People love that!
  What if the whole movie was one giant [Scene] scene?
  I think it needs about {2-7} more {car|train|helicopter|airplane} chases.
  You know what everyone loves? [a=Animal.selectOne.titleCase]s. How can we get [a]s in this movie?
  Let's do this whole movie with puppets!
  Let's have the characters adopt {a} [a=Animal.selectOne] together! Everyone loves [a]s!
  How many [Scene]s scenes can we cram into this movie?
  What if the [Role] was just in one of those "viral videos?" How could you work that into the plot?
  What if all the characters are played by animated fruits and vegetables? You could have Bob the [Fruit.selectUnique(2).joinItems(" and Larry the ")]. But obviously change the names so we don't get sued by Veggie Tales.
  Honestly, I think it's too funny. Can you try a more serious take?
  What's the coolest thing in this movie that we could sell as a toy? Great! Now put that in every scene.
  Can we add one more [Animal] swarm?
  We think this could use a giant mechanical [Animal] at the end of the movie.
  What if the [Role] were the captain of an interstellar space ship?
  How can we make [Animal] repellant central to the plot?
  What if the opening scene was the invasion on D-Day? But also with {a} [Scene].
  Can you work in a talking [Animal] as the mentor?
  We want some really cool 3D scenes for this. What can we make pop out at the crowd?
  Cool, but what if they were all {babies|teenagers|retirees|[Animal]s|[Creature]s}?
  But what's the lesson from the movie?
  Cool, but we want this to be the perfect {New Year's Day|Martin Luther King Jr. Day|Memorial Day|Independence Day|Labor Day|Veterans Day|Thanksgiving|Christmas|Father's Day|Mother's Day|St. Patrick's Day} movie.
  Can we set the whole thing on a derelict space station?
  Good news! I have a friend in [c=Country.selectOne] who wants to be an actor. So we're going to be filming on location there. What [c]-related things can we add to make it relevant? Also, my friend needs to play the [Role] and {he|she} doesn't speak English.
  What if we replace the climax of the movie with {a} [Scene]?
  We really don't like your actor's teeth. Can you just film them from the nose up?
  [Idea] Let's set this on the Titanic.
  What if the [Role] uses a Samsung Galaxy to save the day? We have a deal with Samsung.
  How can we make fidget spinners central to the plot?
  We need more {60|70|80|90|2000|2010}'s pop culture references. Nostalgia is super hot right now.
  What if we set this story in Wonderland?
  Let's replace all of the characters with action figures from the '{80|90}s!
  [Idea] What if the [Role.selectUnique(2).joinItems(" was really the ")] all along?
  We're going to need to use up these {3-100000} gallons of fake blood.
  [Idea] Let's add [character] as the [Role].
  Let's give the [Role] a {chainsaw|axe|sword|knife|hook|bottle opener|screwdriver|hammer|blender} for a hand!
  [Idea] Let's replace the [Role]'s leg with a {machine gun|rifle|laser gun|phaser rifle|lightsaber}!
  What if we add a killer turkey? And set the story on Thanksgiving.
  We're going to need to see a lot more male nudity in this movie. #feminism, am I right?

  Can we add a bunch of alternate reality versions of the [Role]?
  [PubFig] wants to play the [Role]. Can you make that work?
  What if we added a monster trying to kill the main characters in their dreams! But totally different from Friday the 13th of course.
  I have a ceremonial dagger from an old movie that I really want to be the "point" of the script. Get it? Haha! But seriously.
  We need to cast [PubFig] as the [Role]. Sorry.
  We have a deal with {Pizza Hut|Dominos|Little Caesar's|Pizza Pie Cafe}. So how can we make this about pizza saving the day?
  Can you give all the characters superpowers?

  It needs more [Genre]. Just, not in a stereotypical way.
  [Idea] But what if the [Role] was actually working for soviet Russia?

  Can we add some edgy racial tension? That's in the zeitgeist right now.
  We'd like this movie to feature some native culture from [Country]. Not sure what that entails, but add some in, okay?
  But what if we add {a} [Scene] on page {1-120}?
  But what if we cast [PubFig] as the [Role]?
  Can we do this whole movie with puppets? Actors make me nervous.
  I think we need more {tornadoes|floods|hurricaines|earthquakes|wildfires|cyclones|[Creature] invasions} in this movie.
  What if the whole plot was centered around a huge {chess|checkers|poker|blackjack|Monopoly|Scrabble|video game} tournament?
  Too mature. We're aiming at the "under 3" crowd.
  What if the [Role] had a secret pet {dragon|gryphon|pegasus|unicorn}?
  My {4-10}-year-old {niece|nephew} would be perfect for the [Role].
  Let's set this in Jane Austen times. Ladies (18-35) love those dresses!
