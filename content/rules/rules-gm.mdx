# Rules for the GM

<div className="columns">

### Creating Adventures

Use the <Link to="/adventures/">Premade Adventures</Link> or follow the <Link to="/guides/">Guides</Link> to create your own.

### Creating NPCs
Use the <Link to="/NPCs">NPCs App</Link> to prepare your NPCs. Hover over "Create" button and choose a premade NPC to get started with. Add an image, fill in the description. Click on the stats button (top-right corner of the NPC card), and customize their powers, items, and stats.

For friendly/neutral NPCs - decide which items the NPC has in their inventory, in case the players will want to trade with them.

### Awarding Experience
Award experience points to the players for completing quests, overcoming difficult challenges, out-of-the-box thinking, great roleplaying moments, teamwork, and finding clever non-combat resolutions.

Use awarding experience points to control how powerful the party is. Do it slower for longer campaigns, and faster if you want characters to gain powers quicker. Be generous at the beginning of the campaign and allow the new characters to grow and gain the first few powers quickly.

After the players complete a quest or overcome a big challenge, ask players to vote on their favorite character moment, idea, or a joke, and grant the author of the best one an extra experience point.

### Does the player succeed at an action?

Use your own judgment and common sense to decide whether the player's action is successful. If you were reading a novel, and this character had tried to do what the player wants to attempt, would you believe that they succeed?

Follow the rule of cool. The more awesome, creative, or funny the player’s idea is, the more likely it is to work.

Don’t be afraid to add difficulties. When it serves the story, adding tension, drama, and challenges is good. Instead of telling the player that they fail, consider adding drawbacks or unintended negative consequences (“You have successfully killed the guard, but someone has seen it and is now running to raise the alarm.”)



### Combat
There's no initiative or turn order. Call on players when it makes the most sense for their characters to take action (but try to make sure that players get roughly the same amount of screen time). You can also just tell players to take turns in the order in which they sit around the table (or in discord chat).

After the combat, each player can take 1 random item that belonged to an enemy.

### Rule Zero
All these rules are only a guideline, they exist to help you have fun and tell a cool story. If a rule stands in the way of playing the game you enjoy - ignore it or change it. You are free to override any of the rules, to simplify or extend this system. If there’s any confusion about the rules - don’t waste time arguing about them or looking things up. Make the decision that makes the most sense to you and go with it.

<!-- Make sure that failure leads to some negative consequence, interesting complication, or a setback that moves players farther away from their goals.  -->

### Rolling Dice
Tell players to roll the dice only in high stakes, meaningful, dramatic moments when both succeeding and failing at the action could each contribute something interesting to the story. If the roll result doesn't lead to the significant consequences, or if the failure roll doesn't have anything interesting to contribute ("nothing happens") - don't call for a roll, just make the judgement yourself.

Before the roll, set the target number the player needs to beat in order to succeed at a task. Make it higher or lower depending on the difficulty of the task.

If the player fails a roll - you can offer them to reroll the dice at a cost of suffering some negative consequence, complication, a setback, or taking a riskier option.

Some possible complications are: taking damage, losing equipment, losing valuable time, attracting unwanted attention, causing collateral damage, giving the antagonist an opportunity to advance, getting into a risky situation. 


When the player uses an ability relevant to the task they're attempting, comes up with an awesome creative idea, or has an amazing roleplaying moment - tell them to roll with advantage.

In combat, the weapons deal static damage and hit automatically, so rolling dice every turn isn't necessary. Call for a die roll only when there's a reason the attack would be extra difficult/risky, or when it's interesting to have an unpredictable outcome.

The spells never fail to work. Outcomes and results can depend on a roll, but if the player casts a spell, the spell is going to go off and do what it's description says.

Don't hide information behind the roll. If the player describes looking for clues - they find them.

### We're looking for the GMs!
If you're interested in running a lighthearted, low-combat, storytelling/improv-focused one-shot in Mirage (or know a GM who might be) - join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/zt4N23d) and send me a message! (I'm `lumen#7925`)


A few notes:
- Mirage isn't meant for combat-heavy games, and probably won't work great for those. It's designed with storytelling/improv in mind, so it's for people who like that kind of stuff.
- It'd be ideal if I could find people willing to run one-shots, as opposed to long-term campaigns. That way more people on the server would get to play games from time to time, instead of one consistent group with consistent schedule.
- If the rules for GMs are still a bit unclear/confusing - I'll be happy to help! I want to make it as easy as possible for other people to run Mirage games, but I'm not sure if I'm there yet.
