# Character Sheet

All you need to know about your character is stored on your <Link to="/character-sheet">character sheet</Link>.

<div className="columns">

### Stats and Powers
Your character has 3 stats - **Health**, **Energy**, and **Experience**. You also have 4 kinds of "powers" - **Abilities**, **Spells**, **Magic Items**, and **Equipment**. Your character grows stronger when you increase the stats and gain new powers.

### Health Points (HP)
You lose Health Points when you get hurt. Recover points by drinking a potion, using a spell, or taking a rest.
- **Rest** (1 hour in a safe environment) recovers 6 points, but gives the antagonists an opportunity to make a move and advance their plans.
- **Sleep** for 8 restores you to full health.

<!-- You can have at most 12 HP. -->

<div className="column-break"/>

### Energy Points (EP)
Spend them to cast spells and use abilities.

Recover them by drinking a potion, using an ability, or taking a rest (same as health).

<!-- You can have at most 12 EP.  -->

### Experience (XP)
Spend Experience Points to learn Spells and Abilities.

Spend 2 points to increase your max Health or Energy by 1 point.

Gain XP as a reward for overcoming challenges, completing quests, teamwork, and awesome roleplay moments.

# Powers

<div className="columns">

### Learning Spells and Abilities
Abilities and Spells have Levels (1-5, from Novice to Master), and  are organized into Schools (like Warfare, Stealth, Charm, Necromancy).

You can learn first level powers right away. To progress to the more advanced level in the school, you need to learn at least one power from the previous level. So if you want to be able to learn 3rd level Illusionism spells, you need to know one 2nd level Illusionism spell.

To learn a power, spend the number of experience points equal to it's level.

<Power power={exampleSpell} sample />

This spell costs **4** Energy Points to cast, **3** Experience Points to learn, and requires knowing at least one 2nd level spell in **Illusionism** school.

<div className="column-break"/>


### Abilities
You use abilities to do things that are difficult or require expertise. For example, lifting heavy things, picking locks, sneaking, climbing, investigating, seducing, lying.

Without the relevant ability, your character is as good at doing things as an average person.

Example of an ability:

<Power power={exampleAbility} sample />

Using this ability costs **2** Energy points. To learn it, you need to spend **3** Experience points, and you must already know at least one 2nd level ability from **Survival** school.


</div>

# Items

<div className="columns">

### Magic Items and Equipment
Items are classified based on how rare, valuable, and powerful they are (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary, Supreme).

Example item:

<Power power={exampleItem} sample />

This is a **rare** item, it deals **6** damage.


### Inventory
You can carry what your character could reasonably fit in a backpack or on their person. You don't need to buy and manage mundane items (food, paper, regular clothes, ammo) and add them to your inventory - just assume that you have them (use common sense and GMs judgement).


<div className="column-break"/>

### Trading
There’s no currency. There’s no need to micromanage paying for meals, a simple room in an inn - they cost nothing. For the powerful and valuable items, you trade.

You can trade items in your inventory with friendly NPCs and other players. Items don’t have a predetermined price. More powerful/rare items tend to be more valuable, but it all depends on how much the NPC likes you, and how much they want what you have to offer in exchange (a waterskin might be priceless in the desert).

Negotiate and bargain to get a better deal.

</div>

# Action Scenes

<div className="columns">

### Combat
During action scenes (usually combat), the GM will tell you when it's your turn to act. During your turn, your character can **move** and take **one action** (attack, cast a spell, drink a potion, etc).

If you have something that can help you evade the damage (a shield, a spell, a  dodge skill), you can use it when you're attacked.

All attacks hit automatically unless there's a reason they don't (such as enemy using a shield spell). Weapons and spells deal the damage written on their card.

<div className="column-break"/>

### Distances

There are two distances. When something is **In Reach**, it means you can use it, reach it with a melee weapon, or cast a spell that requires touch. When something is **In Range** - you can hit it with a ranged weapon or a spell, or run up to it during your turn.

### Death
If you run out of Health, you pass out. If someone hits you when you’re passed out - you die and turn into a ghost. You can haunt your fellow players until they find a resurrection scroll, or make a new character.


</div>

## Rolling Dice

When you attempt to do something difficult or risky, the GM can tell you to roll a 20-sided die. If your roll is equal to or higher than the target number (set by the GM depending on the difficulty of the task) - you succeed at a task, otherwise you fail.

On a failed roll, GM can sometimes offer you to reroll the dice, at a cost of suffering some negative consequence, complication, a setback, or taking a riskier option.

For example:

> 
- You fail a roll when walking a tightrope over a chasm. You can try to regain your balance, but you will need to drop your sword.
- You fail a roll when trying to pick a lock. You can try to break the lock, but it will trigger the alarm.
- You fail a roll when trying to resuscitate a victim. You can try again, but it will give their attacker the time to escape.
- You fail a roll when trying to lie to another character. You can double down on your lie, but if you fail they will call the guards.


Whenever you roll 20 - you succeed in an exceptionally spectacular way, the outcome is extremely favorable to you. Whenever you roll 1 - you fail and suffer a severe setback (lose equipment, take damage, or face some other misfortune).

You can improve your chances by rolling with **advantage**. That means you roll two dice, and take the highest number. There are 3 ways to gain advantage:

- Use an ability or a spell relevant to the task you are attempting (for example, use "Deception" ability to roll with advantage when attempting to lie to someone).
- Come up with awesome ideas. Creatively use the world around you, find some clever way to approach the task to maximize your chances, or use teamwork to accomplish the task together with other players (describe how you're helping each other out).
- Excellent roleplaying. Act out a dramatic moment, make a speech, describe what you do in an exceptionally vivid and awesome way.

To roll the dice on our discord server, type following commands in the chat:
- `!roll` - roll a single die.
- `!adv` - roll two dice with advantage.

## Creating your Character

To create your character you will need to fill in your <Link to="/character-sheet">character sheet</Link>. It will contain your character’s stats, abilities, spells, inventory, and the description of your character - everything you need for roleplaying.

### Using a premade character sheet (for novice players)
Novice players are highly encouraged to use one of the premade character sheets. Hover over the "Create" button and pick a premade character sheet you think will fit you best. Then all you need is to come up with your character idea (name, appearance, personality, etc), and fill in your character description.

If you’re not sure what kind of character to create - use your favorite character from a book or a movie. If you want to make it more original - combine the traits from several characters (Legolas with the personality of Spider Man, John Snow with the personality of Jack Sparrow), or reverse their gender or a key personality trait (female Tony Stark, evil Hermione, cheerful Batman). If you're still feeling stuck - just play as yourself but with magic powers.

### Custom Character Creation
Players more familiar with their favorite spells and items can create a custom character.

You start with 12 Health, 12 Energy, and 5 Experience.

Create a blank character sheet and:

- Spend your Experience to learn Abilities and Spells.
- Select up to 2 common magic items.
- Select up to 2 common equipment items.

Then fill in appearance/presonality/ambitions/backstory, and you're ready to play.

<!--
- Select up to 2 novice-level abilities.
- Select up to 2 novice-level spells.
-->
