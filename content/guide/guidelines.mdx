# Brainstorming Process

We meet in the discord voice chat, and challenge ourselves to improvise a one-shot adventure in 2 hours. Our goal is to brainstorm fun ideas and improvise stories together in a chill, lighthearted, no-pressure environment.

We do this by filling in the [brainstorming template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nGwOkRbI80hz8O51-S1R081a1Em98bWg9dj6_zQ2NMY/) together. We create a google doc we can all edit, and fill it with our ideas.

We go through the process of creating an adventure step by step, one part of adventure at a time - idea, antagonist, setting, challenges, etc. For every step, we make a list of ideas. We briefly discuss them, and pick our favorite ones.

Then we try to combine these ideas together into a story that makes sense. After a while the process becomes less structured and more freeform - we're trying to fill in the gaps, enhance the ideas we have, find answers to the remaining questions, and turn it all into a complete outline of an adventure.

If everything goes great, at the end of the session we have a draft/outline of an awesome adventure that gives us all the information we need to run it for our players.

After the session we can use the [Adventure Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15s0bm3G3AnOVxayBSZ8X1RbazSWdB-HXPSFTTCQVWxY/) to summarize our ideas, clean up our draft, make our adventure easy to prep and run. We can also playtest the adventure - it will help us improve it and come up with more cool ideas.

The completed adventures are collected in our archive, available to everyone on the internet for free, under [Creative Commons](https://tldrlegal.com/license/creative-commons-attribution-(cc)) license.



<!--
- We "win" this game if by the end of the session we have created a short and simple one-shot adventure together. Doesn't have to be the most brilliant story in the world, it can be silly, we're just trying to make something coherent, something that makes sense. Or, at least, doesn't make sense in a fun and entertaining way. If we end up just joking around and coming up with a bunch of fun adventure ideas, locations, NPCs, and scenes - I'd also call that a victory!

- We do each part for 10 minutes - that way we'll avoid perfectionism and overthinking, we won't try to make the best ideas possible, we'll make up whatever we can and roll with it.
 Or doesn't make sense in a funny way.
- After the session we have a draft/outline of an adventure we can run for our players, or playtest between ourselves.

# Brainstorming Guidelines
This is a list of guidelines that will help us to streamline/simplify things, and give you a clearer picture of how brainstorming sessions work.

The completed brainstorming session docs and adventures made out of them will be saved in our archive, available to everyone on the internet.

### Session Guide
The Session Guide is the person who announces and runs the brainstorming session. Their goal is to guide people through the adventure creation process, keep the conversation on track, and do their best to make sure that we will be able to create a complete story within a reasonable amount of time (1-3 hours).

For now, I am (lumen) going to be the guide, but I hope that once we have established the process - anyone in this community will be able to take initiative, announce, and run the sessions.
2-5 people per session
It's best to limit the group size to 2-5 people. That way everyone has enough time to speak and contribute, things stay more manageable, and the process moves forward faster.

### Types of Sessions
There are two types of sessions:
1. We create an adventure together from scratch, as a group.
2. One person is working on their own adventure, and we run a brainstorming session to help them out.

### Types of Adventures
We should establish the kind of stories we are trying to create. Genre, setting, ruleset, etc. In the future we will experiment with all kinds of stuff, but for now I suggest we focus on this:

- **System agnostic** - our goal is to create a story, the basic idea and outline of an adventure. Ideally - one that can be adapted to any system.
- **One-shot** - this will help us to keep things simple, straightforward, and self-contained. Think of it as an episode of a TV show. It can be ran on it's own, or dropped into your campaign.
- **Generic fantasy** - most people are familiar with the typical DnD-like fantasy setting, so let's start with that.
- **No mechanics** - please avoid discussing mechanics until the end of the session, let’s focus on coming up with the story.
- **Low-combat** - this is my personal preference. Once we have a story and an outline of the adventure, adding combat encounters isn't that difficult.

### Brainstorming Tips
Do your best to “Yes And” people’s ideas. Don’t shut down ideas - build on top of them, add something new, find a way to make them work, make them better.

If you’re struggling to come up with an idea - use one from your favorite Movie, Game, or a TV show.

See if you can combine multiple ideas on the list into something new and exciting. Mix and match tropes. Combine two different movies/characters/settings/plots.

Try to add an unusual/unexpected twist to an idea. Reverse one of its key aspects of the idea, switch the genre, setting, goal, important character traits, etc.

Try to keep every step of brainstorming under 10-20 minutes. It's better to pick a random idea and roll with it than to get stuck trying to make a decision. If we find it difficult to choose the idea we want to focus on - we vote on it or roll the dice to pick a random one.

### Intellectual Property
The authors of the adventure (everyone who has participated in brainstorming) own the rights to the ideas created during the session. They have the right to decide whether the adventure will be published and to have their name in the list of credits.

They can also decide to develop the adventure further, sell it, and share the revenue (discuss it with a group after the session, make sure that everyone is on board with that).

If you are working on your own adventure, want to keep the complete intellectual property rights to it, and are running the session to ask others to help you with brainstorming - discuss this in advance, make it clear before the session begins.

### Code of Conduct
Be good to others, don’t do excessive self promotion, try to stay PG-13, and avoid controversial/divisive topics (real-world politics, religion, sex, etc).

### Questions and Feedback
I’m still trying to figure things out. If you have questions, feedback, or ideas on how to improve our process - let me know! (lumen#7925)
