# Adventure Writers' Room
We are a group of GMs who meet in the discord voice chat, and challenge ourselves to improvise a one-shot adventure in 2 hours. Our goal is to brainstorm fun ideas and improvise stories together in a chill, lighthearted, no-pressure environment.

It's really fun, it works, and it really helps with creating adventures! Usually, by the end of the brainstorming session, we have a solid outline of an adventure we can run for our players.

We're looking for some friendly and creative people to join us! If you want to improvise some stories, stretch your creative muscles, get help writing your adventures, or just have some fun brainstorming ideas - come join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/UVNxeQE)!

# How does it work? 
We use a [brainstorming template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15XiwYU5HSiz8nrASV2Quwgi9UzYvPImhJU24w15IiDc/) to guide us through the adventure creation process. We copy it into a new google doc editable by everyone in the group, go through it step by step, and fill it with our ideas.

We brainstorm ideas and establish the key elements of our adventure: interesting premise, the goal our players will pursue, setting and locations they'll visit, characters they'll meet, challenges they'll encounter. For every step, we make a list of ideas, briefly discuss them, and pick our favorite ones.

Then we try to combine our ideas into a short outline of an adventure, put it all together into a list of scenes that flow into each other, add up to an interesting story that makes sense. We use the [One-Page Adventure Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18042W2EP9DfMc9lGhxkEOwcti3ETmv70xqVyDWSRnPw/) to create a short summary of everything we have brainstormed, it will give us all the information we need to run the adventure for our players, or playtest it between ourselves.

Our best adventures are published on this website, available to everybody on the internet for free (as long as everyone who has participated in the brainstorm is okay with that).

To get the most out of our brainstorming sessions read our [Brainstorming Guidelines](https://rpgadventures.io/brainstorming-guidelines), they contain a list of useful tips that will help you to get better at brainstorming.

If you need help coming up with ideas, use our [Writing Prompts Tool](https://perchance.org/adventure-prompts).

Once you have participated in a few sessions and feel like youâ€™re getting the hang of the process - feel free to announce and run your own sessions. Learn how to run the sessions [here](https://rpgadventures.io/session-guide).

If you have some questions, feedback, or need any help - free to message me (`lumen#7925` on Discord).
