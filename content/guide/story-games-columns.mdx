# Story Games

Story games are for people who love improvisation, freeform roleplay. We go on imaginary adventures in a lighthearted atmosphere with other friendly and creative people. Together we improvise stories from scratch, with no preparation. If you feel like stretching your creative muscles - come [join us](https://discord.gg/gNrJJNMuyD) on one of our adventures!

## How to Play

<div className="columns"> 
<div className="col">

### Brainstorm
We use a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg6jXg47vivpyKBfPQnO_SKSV0BIO1RMurGhRSc1rDA/" target="_blank">Story Template</a> to guide us through the game. We brainstorm to establish the important elements of our adventure: interesting premise, goal, setting, non-player characters, challenges we may encounter. 

### Create Characters 
Create the player characters, establish who they are, what abilities they have, their motivations and relationships.

### Freeform  Roleplay 
Then we improvise the scenes of the adventure. The template contains a list of key plot points, we use them to guide our improv, strive to incorporate them into the story.

### Tell a fun story
 We win the game if we have created an interesting story that makes sense and resolves in an awesome and satisfying climax.

### Game Master
One player becomes a Game Master (GM) - the narrator of our story. GM describes the world around the players, plays the role of non-player characters, decides what challenge the players will face next, and narrates the consequences of their actions. 

### Players take turns GMing scenes
Players take turns GMing. One player GMs a scene, we play through it, the next player GMs the next one. Each scene revolves around players trying to overcome the challenge established by the GM. The scene ends when the challenge is resolved. 

### Collaborative Storytelling 
If the current GM has trouble figuring out what happens next, they can tap out and let someone else continue the story. When necessary, we can pause between the scenes for a quick brainstorm and figure things out together.

<!-- All players actively contribute to the story, introduce new ideas, fill in missing information, create interesting situations, help to advance the story and take the adventure in new directions. -->

## Create your Character

Copy this template, fill it, post it in the game chat:

> **\*\*Name\*\***: <Character's Name>  
**\*\*Description\*\***: <Who are you? Appearance, occupation, personality, backstory.>  
**\*\*Abilities\*\***: <What can you do? Cool powers, special skills, useful items.>  

You can use <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q1YW4y841wNOxyhG9fbsVkf75eGwkP3KhZjCrb6U0f0/view#heading=h.n9qq57m0sk5u" target="_blank">this list</a> of cool abilities, motivations, and relationships for inspiration.

## Rolling Dice
After you describe your approach to solving a challenge, roll a 20-sided die to determine the outcome. If you roll above the target number (set by the GM) - you succeed. Otherwise you suffer a negative consequence, setback, or a complication. 

The target number represents your likelihood of success, it depends on the difficulty of the task, situation you're in, and your approach to solving a challenge. GM sets lower target numbers for easier tasks and clever solutions, and higher numbers for difficult situations and risky actions. If you saw characters in a movie attempt something like this, would you expect it to work?

If your character is using an ability relevant to the task you’re attempting, you roll with advantage (roll two dice and take the best result). Type `!roll` in the chat for a regular roll, type `!adv` to roll with advantage. 



<!-- 

**\*\*Motivations\*\***: <What do you want from this quest? What are your goals?>  
**\*\*Relationships\*\***: <Pick at least one PC to establish a relationship with.\>  
Connection -  How do you know each other? What do you think about them?  
Tension - What do you want from them? Why do they refuse to give it to you?  

Motivations and Relationships are filled in during the game, after the brainstorm.  

 -->


<!-- 
### Freeform Roleplay
Freeform roleplay doesn't have many rules - there's nothing stopping us from doing anything we can imagine, but we trust each other to play fairly - avoid gamebreaking actions, do things that make sense in the story, and try to make it interesting and fun for other players.

## Play Offline
To play offline, you need a print out the <a href="/files/story-games.pdf" target="_blank">rules</a>. You also need some 20-sided dice (ideally 2 per player, but 1 die for the group will do), and a print out of the <a href="/template.pdf" target="_blank">blank-story-template</a> to write down your ideas on.

<!-- The GM considers the difficulty of the task, situation the players are in, their approach to solving the challenge. GM uses their common sense to decide how likely the players are to succeed. Set lower numbers for easier tasks or clever solutions, set higher numbers for difficult challenges or reckless actions. If you saw characters in a movie attempt something like this, would you expect it to work? -->

<!-- 

### Consequences
The situation always changes after a roll, moving the characters closer to or farther away from their goals. Each outcome moves the plot forward, takes the story in a different direction. Failure always leads to consequences - the characters suffer a temporary defeat, face a complication, or have to try a different approach.

### Action and Combat Scenes
Don't roll for separate attacks/actions. Use dice to determine the outcomes of decisive moments in the conflict, dramatically interesting turning points. 

Resolve most fights in one roll. Describe how you're fighting, roll to see if you win. Defeating a fearsome enemy (like a dragon) may require 2-4 challenges (get close enough while avoiding it's attacks, pry open one of it's scales, land a killing blow).

Players don't die, but you can describe how they got hurt and take it into account when deciding the difficulty of future challenges. If the situation gets severe, players may be forced to escape or be left at the mercy of their enemies.
