# Freeform Roleplaying
Our games are for people who love storytelling, improvisation, and freeform roleplay. We go on imaginary adventures, play out fun stories in a lighthearted atmosphere with other friendly and creative people. Come [join us](https://discord.gg/gNrJJNMuyD)!

## Creating your Character
Copy this template, fill it in, post it in `#characters`.
> **\*\*Name\*\***: <Character's Name>  
**\*\*Description\*\***: <Who are you? Appearance, personality, occupation, motivations.>  
**\*\*Abilities\*\***: <What can you do? Cool powers, special skills, spells, useful items.>  

Come up with up to 8 abilities, feel free to use <a href="/files/abilities.pdf" target="_blank">this list of powers</a> for inspiration.

Example:
> **Name**: Salazar Von Neumann  
> **Description**:  
Former Dark Lord who has lost his powers and memories after being defeated by the pesky band of plucky heroes. Now undead, he travels the world trying to solve the mystery of his past. A slender figure clad in flawlessly elegant black robes, charred skull, emerald flames burning within the empty eye sockets.  
> **Abilities**:  
Charming and devious Wizard. Can use telekinesis (on small objects), create minor illusions, send telepathic messages. Has a Cloak of Disguise which allows him to assume an appearance of any humanoid creature up to 4 times per day. Has a charming demon-familiar named Faust.

Discuss your abilities with the GM. If an ability is too powerful, add a cost or a limitation - maybe it takes time to use, has negative consequences (attracts attention, is unpredictable, puts you in danger, etc), maybe it can only be used once (treat it as a potion), and so on. 

After each adventure, your character can gain a new ability or improve one they already have by removing some of its limitations.


## Rolling the Dice
When you attempt a task that is difficult or risky, the GM can tell you to roll a 20-sided die. If you roll above the target number (set by the GM) - you succeed, otherwise you suffer a negative consequence, setback, or a complication.

The target number depends on the difficulty of the task, situation you're in, and your approach to solving a challenge. GM sets lower numbers for easier tasks and clever solutions, and higher numbers for difficult situations and risky actions. If you saw a movie character attempt something like this, would you expect it to work?

<!-- The target number represents your likelihood of success, it depends on the difficulty of the task, situation you're in, and your approach to solving a challenge. GM sets lower target numbers for easier tasks and clever solutions, and higher numbers for difficult situations and risky actions. If you saw characters in a movie attempt something like this, would you expect it to work? -->

<!-- If you're using an ability or an item relevant to the task you're attempting - roll with **advantage** (roll multiple dice, and take the best result). Roll an extra die for each ability you're using, up to the maximum of 4. -->

You can improve your chances by rolling with **advantage**. That means you roll multiple dice, and take the best result. Roll with advantage when you use an ability or an item relevant to the task you’re attempting. If you want to use multiple abilities - roll an extra die for each one, up to the maximum of 4. Example:
> If you’re trying to really scare someone, and your character is Strong (scary looking), Insightful (can figure out someone's biggest fear), and is holding a Bloody Axe, you can use all 3 to roll 4 dice with advantage.  

Type `!roll` in the discord chat for a regular roll, type `!adv2`, `!adv3`, or `!adv4` to roll multiple dice with advantage.


# Roleplaying  Guidelines

Follow these guidelines to get the most out of our games. If you’re new - don’t get too overwhelmed by all these tips. Practice them one at a time - pick one principle you’d like to get better at, and focus on that one thing for the duration of the game.

<div className="columns">

### Play to find out what happens
Do things that result in a good story, optimize for fun instead of “winning”.

### Yes, and
Treat the ideas suggested by other players as awesome (even when they may seem silly). Don’t shut down people’s ideas - embrace them, help them succeed. Adopt ideas, build on top of them, add something new, find a way to make them work, make them better. Help other players be awesome. Actively help others to have cool moments and achieve their goals, create opportunities for other characters to shine.

### Share the Spotlight
Try to make sure that all players have enough opportunities to participate in the story. Avoid talking over other players and dominating the conversation, but don’t be afraid to speak up when you have something fun to contribute. Help quiet/shy players - ask their opinion or what they would like to do next. If you notice someone being interrupted - ask them what they were about to say.

### Contribute to the story
Don’t be afraid to add information to the story. Help the GM to establish the scene, point out interesting details in the world around you. Answer unsolved questions, come up with explanations for things that seems inconsistent, fill in the gaps, help to create a story that makes sense.

### Advance the Plot
Help the GM to move the story along. If you notice that players are stuck talking to each other and going nowhere - make a decision, conclude this scene, and move on to the next one.

### Be an active player
Don’t wait for others to entertain you, assume the responsibility for making the story more fun for yourself and others, try to actively contribute ideas to the story, enhance everyone’s experience. Positive energy and enthusiasm are always welcome.

### Stay in character
Try to immerse yourself in playing your character, like an actor. Try playing characters with real feelings and believable motivations. Try to make other people love and care about your character. Think about your character’s distinctive features, quirks, unique speech patterns. Don’t be shy to act it out, do a silly voice.

### Develop your Character
What are their values and ideals? What do they fear? What flaws/weaknesses do they need to overcome? What is their backstory, significant events that shaped them? What is their deep dark secret? Do they have a strong opinion about what’s going on? What’s going through their head at this moment?

### Goals and Motivations
Figure out what your character wants, form your own goals, pursue them, creatively overcome obstacles on your way. What does your character want from life? What is their current goal? What do they want from this quest?

### Explore the Relationships
How does your character feel about the other party members? Establish a connection. How do you know each other? What do you think about them?

Create interesting tension, conflict dynamics between the characters in the party (while still collaborating as players). What does your character need from another PC? Why do they refuse to give it to you? Could your goals be at odds with each other? As the story goes on, how can your characters resolve the conflict?

### Allow yourself to feel
This game can get really amazing when you allow yourself to really feel what your character feels in the moment. Being excited, scared, even crying. When you feel safe to express emotions around your friends, and really care about your character and theirs, you will have some amazing and unforgettable moments.

### Relax and have fun
If you’re feeling stuck and having trouble coming up with ideas - just do whatever seems to make sense at the moment. Often an idea that seems simple and obvious to you will lead to something interesting. Remember, as long as you and others are enjoying the game - you’re doing great! 

### Make Friends
Get to know people outside the games. Leave some time for a bit of socializing before or after the games, chat between the games in the text channel.
