# Story Games
The goal of story games is to improvise and play out fun adventures, create stories from scratch, with no preparation. It is a combination of adventure brainstorming, collaborative storytelling, freeform roleplay, and improv.

## How to Play
We are the players and GMs of our story at the same time. We create our characters, decide what adventure to go on, set up the scenes, and play through them, trying to tell a fun story and resolve it in an awesome and satisfying climax.

We use the [Story Games Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg6jXg47vivpyKBfPQnO_SKSV0BIO1RMurGhRSc1rDA/) to guide us through the game.  We use [prompts](https://rpgadventures.io/prompts) to establish the important details about our adventure: our goal, adventure setting, and the important characters. Then we improvise the scenes of our story.

Players take turns GMing. One player GMs a scene, we play through it, the next player GMs the next one. The current GM decides what challge/obstacle the players will face next, describes the world around the players, plays the role of non-player characters, and narrates the consequences of players' actions. While you GM a scene, your character temporarily becomes an NPC. 

If the current GM feels stuck, they can tap out and let someone else continue the story. If we're all feeling stuck, we can pause for a quick brainstorm and figrue out what happens next together. All players actively contribute to the story, introduce new ideas, fill in missing information, create interesting situations, help to take adventure in interesiting directions.

Because freeform roleplay doesn't have many rules, there's nothing stopping us from doing anything we can imagine, but we trust each other to play fairly - avoid game-breaking actions, do things that make sense in the story, and try to make it interesting and fun for other players.

## Create your Character

Copy this template, fill it in, post it in the game chat:

```
**Name**: <Character's Name>
**Description**: <Appearance, personality, occupation, motivations.>
**Abilities**: <Cool stuff you can do. Spells and non-magical skills.>
**Inventory**: <Useful items and equipment you have.>
```
You can use [this list](http://playmirage.io/all-powers) of cool abilities/items for inspiration.


## Rolling Dice
Roll dice for successes/failures of major actions, significant outcomes. If you roll above the target number (set by the GM depending on the difficulty of the task) - you succeed, otherwise you fail. On a failed roll, you can reroll the die at a cost of suffering a negative consequence, setback, complication, or taking a riskier option.

Roll with advantage if you use an ability or an item relevant to the task you're attempting. Type `!roll` in the chat for a regular roll, type `!adv` to roll with advantage.
