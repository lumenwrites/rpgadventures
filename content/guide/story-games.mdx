# Story Games

Story games are for people who love improvisation and freeform roleplay. We go on imaginary adventures in a lighthearted atmosphere with other friendly and creative people. Together we improvise stories from scratch, with no preparation. It is a combination of roleplaying, brainstorming, collaborative storytelling, and improv. If you feel like stretching your creative muscles - come [join us](https://discord.gg/gNrJJNMuyD) on one of our adventures!

## How to Play
<!-- 
During the first part of the game we create our characters and decide what adventure we want to go on.   -->

We use the [Story Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg6jXg47vivpyKBfPQnO_SKSV0BIO1RMurGhRSc1rDA/) to guide us through the game. We establish the important elements of our adventure: interesting premise, our goal, setting, characters, and challenges we may encounter. Then we roleplay - improvise the scenes of our adventure, trying to tell a fun story, making things up as we go.

One player becomes a Game Master (GM) - the narrator of our story. GM describes the world around the players, plays the role of non-player characters, decides what challenge/obstacle the players will face next, and narrates the consequences of their actions. The rest of the players play as their characters.

<!-- The rest of the players pretend to be their characters, playing their role in the story like actors. -->

Players take turns GMing. One player GMs a scene, we play through it, the next player GMs the next one. Each scene revolves around players trying to overcome the challenge established by the GM. The scene ends when the challenge is resolved. 

If the current GM has trouble figuring out what happens next, they can tap out and let someone else continue the story. When necessary, we can pause between the scenes for a quick brainstorm and figure things out together.

All players actively contribute to the story, introduce new ideas, fill in missing information, create interesting situations, help to advance the story and take the adventure in new directions.

We win the game if we have created an interesting story that makes sense and resolves in an awesome and satisfying climax.

## Create your Character

Copy this template, fill it in, post it in the game chat:

```
**Name**: <Character's Name>
**Description**: <Who are you? Appearance, personality, occupation, goals.>
**Abilities**: <What can you do? Cool powers, special skills, useful items.>
```
You can use [this list](http://playmirage.io/all-powers) of cool abilities/items for inspiration.

<!-- 
```
**Relationship**: <What do you want from another PC that they won’t give you?>
**Name**: <Character's Name>
**Description**: <Appearance, personality, occupation, motivations.>
**Abilities**: <Cool stuff you can do. Spells and non-magical skills.>
**Inventory**: <Useful items and equipment you have.>
```
 -->

## Rolling Dice
Roll a 20-sided die to determine successes/failures of major actions, significant outcomes. If you roll above the target number (set by the GM depending on the difficulty of the task) - you succeed, otherwise you fail. On a failed roll, you can reroll the die at a cost of suffering a negative consequence, setback, complication, or taking a riskier option.
 
If your character is using an ability or an item relevant to the task you’re attempting, you roll with advantage (roll two dice and take the best result).  
Type `!roll` in the chat for a regular roll, type `!adv` to roll with advantage.

## Freeform Roleplay
Freeform roleplay doesn't have many rules - there's nothing stopping us from doing anything we can imagine, but we trust each other to play fairly - avoid gamebreaking actions, do things that make sense in the story, and try to make it interesting and fun for other players.

To get the most out of our games, take a look at our [roleplaying guidelines](/storygames-guidelines).
