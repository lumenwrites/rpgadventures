# Story Games

Story games are for people who love improvisation and freeform roleplay. We go on imaginary adventures in a lighthearted atmosphere with other friendly and creative people. Together we improvise stories from scratch, with no preparation. It is a combination of roleplaying, brainstorming, collaborative storytelling, and improv. If you feel like stretching your creative muscles - come [join us](https://discord.gg/gNrJJNMuyD) on one of our adventures!

## How to Play
We use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Eg6jXg47vivpyKBfPQnO_SKSV0BIO1RMurGhRSc1rDA/" target="_blank">Story Template</a> to guide us through the game. First, we brainstorm to establish the important elements of our adventure: interesting premise, our goal, setting, characters, and challenges we may encounter. 

<!-- When we need help coming up with ideas, we use <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q1YW4y841wNOxyhG9fbsVkf75eGwkP3KhZjCrb6U0f0/" target="_blank">prompts</a>. -->

Then we roleplay - improvise the scenes of our adventure, trying to tell a fun story, making things up as we go. The template contains a list of key plot points, we strive to incorporate them into our story, use them to guide our improv.

One player becomes a Game Master (GM) - the narrator of our story. GM describes the world around the players, plays the role of non-player characters, decides what challenge/obstacle the players will face next, and narrates the consequences of their actions. The rest of the players play as their characters.

<!-- The rest of the players pretend to be their characters, playing their role in the story like actors. -->

Players take turns GMing. One player GMs a scene, we play through it, the next player GMs the next one. Each scene revolves around players trying to overcome the challenge established by the GM. The scene ends when the challenge is resolved. 

If the current GM has trouble figuring out what happens next, they can tap out and let someone else continue the story. When necessary, we can pause between the scenes for a quick brainstorm and figure things out together.

All players actively contribute to the story, introduce new ideas, fill in missing information, create interesting situations, help to advance the story and take the adventure in new directions.

We win the game if we have created an interesting story that makes sense and resolves in an awesome and satisfying climax.

## Create your Character

Copy this template, fill it in, post it in the game chat:


> **\*\*Name\*\***: <Character's Name>  
**\*\*Description\*\***: <Who are you? Appearance, personality, occupation, motivations.>  
**\*\*Abilities\*\***: <What can you do? Cool powers, special skills, useful items.>  

You can use <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q1YW4y841wNOxyhG9fbsVkf75eGwkP3KhZjCrb6U0f0/view#heading=h.n9qq57m0sk5u" target="_blank">this list</a> of cool abilities, motivations, and relationships for inspiration.

<!-- 
> **\*\*Name\*\***: <Character's Name>  
**\*\*Description\*\***: <Who are you? Appearance, occupation, personality, backstory.>  
**\*\*Abilities\*\***: <What can you do? Cool powers, special skills, useful items.>  
**\*\*Motivations\*\***: <What do you want from this quest? What are your goals?>  
**\*\*Relationships\*\***: <Your Connection to another PC and Tension between you.\>  

Motivations and Relationships are filled in during the game, after the brainstorm.  
Pick at least one PC to establish a relationship with.  
Connection -  How do you know each other? What do you think about them?  
Tension - What do you want from them? Why do they refuse to give it to you?

## Rolling Dice
After you describe your approach to solving a challenge, roll a 20-sided die to determine outcome. If you roll above the target number (set by the GM) - you succeed. Otherwise you suffer a negative consequence, setback, or a complication.

If your character is using an ability relevant to the task you’re attempting, you roll with advantage (roll two dice and take the best result).  

### Setting a target number
The GM considers the difficulty of the task, situation the players are in, and their approach to solving the challenge. GM uses their common sense to decide how likely the players are to succeed. Set lower numbers for easier tasks or clever solutions, set higher numbers for difficult challenges or reckless actions. If you saw characters in a movie attempt something like this, would you expect it to work?

### Consequences
The situation always changes after a roll, moving the characters closer to or farther away from their goals. Each outcome moves the plot forward, takes the story in a different direction. Failure always leads to consequences - the characters suffer a temporary defeat, face a complication, or have to try a different approach.

<!-- Type `!roll` in the chat for a regular roll, type `!adv` to roll with advantage. -->

### Combat
Don't roll for separate attacks. Use the dice to determine the outcomes of decisive moments in the conflict, dramatically interesting turning points. 

Resolve most fights in one roll. Describe how you're fighting, roll to see if you win. Defeating a fearsome enemy (like a dragon) may require 2-4 challenges (get close enough while avoiding it's attacks, pry open one of it's scales, land a killing blow).

Players don't die, but you can describe how they got hurt and take it into account when deciding the difficulty of future challenges. If the situation gets severe, players may be forced to escape or be left at the mercy of their enemies.

<!-- 
Use the dice to determine the outcomes of decisive moments in the conflict, dramatically interesting turning points, not individual actions. Describe how you're fighting, roll once to determine whether you win or lose.

Defeating a fearsome enemy (like a dragon) might require several challenges (get close enough while avoiding it's attacks, back it into a corner, pry open one of it's scales, use teamwork to land a killing blow), but it never happens blow-by-blow.

If players backed into a corner, and the situation gets severe
Players don't have healthbars, but you can describe how they got hurt, making it more difficult to fight, and take it into account when setting target numbers for future challenges. Players don't die, but they can be forced to escape, get captured, left at the mercy of their enemies.

outcome of the scene.
Roll a 20-sided die to determine successes/failures of major actions, significant outcomes. If you roll above the target number (set by the GM depending on the difficulty of the task) - you succeed, otherwise you fail. On a failed roll, you can reroll the die at a cost of suffering a negative consequence, setback, complication, or taking a riskier option. 

(set by the GM depending on the difficulty of the challenge and your approach to solving it)
Otherwise you fail and suffer a negative consequence, setback or complication that moves you farther away from your goals.

If you roll 1 - you suffer a severe setback, making your goal more difficult to achive.

The situation always changes after a roll, for good or ill, each outcome pushes the story forward. Failures always create new situations, the result is never "nothing happens". They change the story, make the scene end badly for the character, move you farther away from your goals, making them more difficult to achieve. When you fail - you or GM describe how this failure results in a complication/setback at your personal character goal, or at the main goal the party is pursuing on this quest.

If your character is using an ability or an item relevant to the task you’re attempting, you roll with advantage (roll two dice and take the best result).  
Type `!roll` in the chat for a regular roll, type `!adv` to roll with advantage.

## Freeform Roleplay
Freeform roleplay doesn't have many rules - there's nothing stopping us from doing anything we can imagine, but we trust each other to play fairly - avoid gamebreaking actions, do things that make sense in the story, and try to make it interesting and fun for other players.

To get the most out of our games, take a look at our [guidelines](/storygames-guidelines).

## Play Offline
To play offline, you need a print out the rules. Use <a href="/files/story-games-printable-A4.pdf" target="_blank">printable A4 pages</a>, or a pretty <a href="/files/story-games-booklet.pdf" target="_blank">A5 booklet</a>. You also need some 20-sided dice (ideally 2 per player, but 1 die for the group will do), and something to write down your ideas on.
