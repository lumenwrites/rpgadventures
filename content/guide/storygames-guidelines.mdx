# Story Games Guidelines
Follow these guidelines to get the most out of our [games](/story-games). If you’re new - don’t get too overwhelmed by all these tips. Practice them one at a time - pick one principle you’d like to get better at, and focus on that one thing for the duration of the game. When GMing, try to encourage players to follow these principles.

### Brainstorm what’s hard to improvise
During the brainstorming part, try to make sure we have prepared everything that would be hard to improvise on the spot, but no more.

### Take inspiration
If you’re struggling to come up with a creative idea - use one from your favorite Movie, Game, or a TV show. Mix and match tropes. Combine two different movies, characters, settings, or plots. Try to add an unusual unexpected twist to an idea. Reverse one of its key aspects of the idea, switch the genre, setting, goal, important character traits, etc.

### Grounded Story, Funny Roleplay
When brainstorming/GMing, focus on creating a good, interesting story with a solid plot, establishing the base reality that makes sense. Don’t try to make it funny - try to create a grounded believable world on top of which we can improvise funny and entertaining situations.

### Play to find out what happens
Do things that result in a good story, optimize for fun instead of “winning”.

### Yes, and
Treat the ideas suggested by other players as awesome (even when they may seem silly). Don’t shut down people’s ideas - embrace them, help them succeed. Adopt ideas, build on top of them, add something new, find a way to make them work, make them better. Help other players be awesome. Actively help others to have cool moments and achieve their goals, create opportunities for other characters to shine. When GMing, listen to players and build off of the ideas they contribute.

### Contribute to the story
Don’t be afraid to add information to the story. Help the GM to establish the scene, point out interesting details in the world around you. Vividly describe what you do. Answer unanswered questions, provide explanations for information that seems inconsistent, help to create a story that makes sense. Help the GM to move the story along. If you notice that players are stuck talking to each other and going nowhere - make a decision, conclude this scene, and move on to the next one.

### Keep up good pace
Aim for a 3-hour game. 40 minutes for brainstorm, 30 minutes per plot point (adventure hook and resolution can be shorter, climax can be longer). Keep scenes short. Start scenes as close to the action as possible, end them as soon as the interesting part over.

### Ask Questions
When GMing, draw players into the story by asking questions “How does your character feel about x?”, “What’s going through their head as they do y?”, “Describe how you want to do z.”

### Develop your Character
What is their current goal? What do they want from this quest? What are their values and ideals? What do they fear? What flaws/weaknesses do they need to overcome? What is their backstory, significant events that shaped them? What is their deep dark secret? Do they have a strong opinion about what’s going on? What’s going through their head at this moment? 

### Be an active player
Don’t wait for others to entertain you, assume the responsibility for making the story more fun for yourself and others, try to actively contribute ideas to the story, enhance everyone’s experience. Positive energy and enthusiasm are always welcome. 

### Be a proactive character
Don’t wait for the GM to provide every detail and tell you what to do. Figure out what your character wants, form your own goals, pursue them, and creatively overcome obstacles on their way. 

### Stay in character
Try to immerse yourself in playing your character, like an actor. Try playing characters with real feelings and believable motivations. Try to make other people love and care about your character. Think about your character’s distinctive features, quirks, unique speech patterns. Don’t be shy to act it out, do a silly voice.

### Create and Explore the Relationships
How does your character feel about the other party members? Do you have history? Create interesting tension, conflict dynamics between the characters in the party (while still collaborating as players). What does your character want from another PC? Why do they refuse to give it to you? Could your goals be at odds with each other? As the story goes on, can your characters resolve the conflict, find an agreement, a win-win outcome?

<!-- characters want opposite things?  -->

### Relax and have fun
If you’re feeling stuck and having trouble coming up with ideas - just do whatever seems to make sense at the moment. Often an idea that seems simple and obvious to you will lead to something interesting. Remember, as long as you and others are enjoying the game - you’re doing great! 

### Make Friends
Get to know people outside the games. Leave some time for a bit of socializing before or after the games, chat between the games in the text channel.
