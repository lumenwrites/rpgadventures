<div className="col">


### Play to find out what happens
Do things that result in a good story, optimize for fun instead of "winning".

### Yes, and
Treat the ideas suggested by other players as awesome (even when they may seem silly). Don’t shut down people’s ideas - go with it, encourage it, help them succeed. Create the story by combining everyone's ideas and building on top of them.

### Help other players be awesome
Actively help others to have cool moments and achieve their goals, create opportunities for other characters to shine.

### Be an active player
Don't wait for others to entertain you, assume the responsibility for making the story more fun for yourself and others, try to actively contribute ideas to the story, enhance everyone's experience. Positive energy and enthusiasm are always welcome. As a character - be proactive, form your own goals, don't wait for the GM to provide every detail and tell you what to do.

### Describe
Try to describe what you do vividly, don't be afraid to add fun details to the story.

### Stay in character
Try to immerse yourself in playing your character, like an actor. Try playing characters with real feelings and believable motivations. Try to make other people love and care about your character.

### Create Relationships
Exploring the relationships between characters - how does your character feel about the NPCs and other party members? What do they want from another character, and why is it difficult to get?

### Motivations
What are your goals? What does your character want from life? From this quest? What do they fear? 

### Add an emotion and opinion
Does your character have a strong opinion about what’s going on? What's going through their head at this moment? How do they feel?

### Relax and have fun
Don't be too overwhelmed by all these tips, if you’re feeling stuck and having trouble coming up with ideas - just do whatever seems to make sense at the moment. Remember, as long as you and others are enjoying the game - you're doing great!
