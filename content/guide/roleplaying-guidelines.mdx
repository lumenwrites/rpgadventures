# Roleplaying Guidelines

Follow these guidelines to get the most out of our [games](/story-games). 

If you're a GM, try to encourage the players to follow these principles by asking them questions like "How does your character feel about [x]?", "What's going through their head as they do [y]?", "Describe how do you want to do this", etc.

If you're new - don't get too overwhelmed by all these tips. Practice them one at a time - pick one principle you'd like to get better at, and focus on that one thing for the duration of the game.

### Play to find out what happens
Do things that result in a good story, optimize for fun instead of "winning".

### Yes, and
Treat the ideas suggested by other players as awesome (even when they may seem silly). Don’t shut down people’s ideas - go with it, encourage it, help them succeed. Build on top of other people's ideas, add something new, find a way to make them work, make them better. 

### Help other players be awesome
Actively help others to have cool moments and achieve their goals, create opportunities for other characters to shine.


### Describe things vividly
Try to describe what you do vividly, don't be afraid to add fun details to the story. Try to be specific, engage multiple senses, describe how does the scene look like, sound like, smell like, etc.

### Add an emotion and opinion
Does your character have a strong opinion about what’s going on? What's going through their head at this moment? How do they feel?

### Act it out
Think about your character's distinctive features, quirks, unique speech patterns. Don't be shy to do a silly voice.

### Motivations
What does your character want from life? What is their current goal? What do they want from this quest? What are their values and ideals? What do they fear? 

### Flaws
Give your character a flaw or a weakness they need to overcome.

### Backstory
What is your character's backstory, significant events that shaped them. What is their deep dark secret?

### Be an active player
Don't wait for others to entertain you, assume the responsibility for making the story more fun for yourself and others, try to actively contribute ideas to the story, enhance everyone's experience. Positive energy and enthusiasm are always welcome. As a character - be proactive, form your own goals, don't wait for the GM to provide every detail and tell you what to do.

### Take inspiration
If you’re struggling to come up with a creative idea - use one from your favorite Movie, Game, or a TV show. Mix and match tropes. Combine two different movies, characters, settings, or plots. Try to add an unusual unexpected twist to an idea. Reverse one of its key aspects of the idea, switch the genre, setting, goal, important character traits, etc.

### Stay in character
Try to immerse yourself in playing your character, like an actor. Try playing characters with real feelings and believable motivations. Try to make other people love and care about your character.

### Create Relationships
Explore the relationships between characters - how does your character feel about the other party members (or NPCs)? Create interesting conflict dynamics between the characters in the party - your character needs something from someone and they're not giving it to you.

### Relax and have fun
If you’re feeling stuck and having trouble coming up with ideas - just do whatever seems to make sense at the moment. Often an idea that seems simple and obvious to you will lead to something interesting. Remember, as long as you and others are enjoying the game - you're doing great!
