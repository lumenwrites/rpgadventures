# Roleplaying Guidelines

Follow these guidelines to get the most out of our [games](/story-games). 

If you're a GM, try to encourage the players to follow these principles by asking them questions like "How does your character feel about [x]?", "What's going through their head as they do [y]?", "Describe how do you want to do this", etc.

<!-- , "What interesting detail does your character notice about this location?", or, during the long journey, ask "What happened during your journey?" -->

If you're new - don't get too overwhelmed by all these tips. Practice them one at a time - pick one principle you'd like to get better at, and focus on that one thing for the duration of the game.

### Play to find out what happens
Do things that result in a good story, optimize for fun instead of "winning".

### Yes, and
Treat the ideas suggested by other players as awesome (even when they may seem silly). Don’t shut down people’s ideas - embrace them, help them succeed. Adopt ideas, build on top of them, add something new, find a way to make them work, make them better. 

<!-- go with it, encourage it -->

### Help other players be awesome
Actively help others to have cool moments and achieve their goals, create opportunities for other characters to shine.

### Describe things vividly
Try to describe what you do vividly. Try to be specific, engage multiple senses, describe how does the scene look like, sound like, smell like, etc.

<!-- Be specific. "I break the door" vs "I swing my warhammer and smash the door into pieces". -->

### Contribute to the story
Don't be afraid to add information to the story. Help the GM to establish the scene, point out interesting details in the world around you. Create and protect the reality of the scene. Answer unanswered questions, provide explanation for information that seems inconsistent, help to create a story that makes sense. 

<!-- justify inconsistencies,  -->

### Move the story along
Help the GM to push the story forward (towards the climax). If you notice that players are stuck talking to each other and going nowhere - make a decision, take action, help players to conclude this scene and move on to the next one.

### Goals and Motivations
Figure out what your character wants, pursue it, and creatively overcome obstacles on their way. What is their current goal? What do they want from this quest? What do they want from life?  What are their values and ideals? What do they fear? 

<!-- What does your character want?  -->

### Emotions and opinions
Does your character have a strong opinion about what’s going on? What's going through their head at this moment? How do they feel?

### Flaws
Give your character a flaw or a weakness they need to overcome.

### Backstory
What is your character's backstory, significant events that shaped them. What is their deep dark secret?

### Be an active player
Don't wait for others to entertain you, assume the responsibility for making the story more fun for yourself and others, try to actively contribute ideas to the story, enhance everyone's experience. Positive energy and enthusiasm are always welcome. As a character - be proactive, form your own goals, don't wait for the GM to provide every detail and tell you what to do.

### Take inspiration
If you’re struggling to come up with a creative idea - use one from your favorite Movie, Game, or a TV show. Mix and match tropes. Combine two different movies, characters, settings, or plots. Try to add an unusual unexpected twist to an idea. Reverse one of its key aspects of the idea, switch the genre, setting, goal, important character traits, etc.

### Stay in character
Try to immerse yourself in playing your character, like an actor. Try playing characters with real feelings and believable motivations. Try to make other people love and care about your character.

### Act it out
Think about your character's distinctive features, quirks, unique speech patterns. Don't be shy to do a silly voice.

### Create Relationships
Explore the relationships between characters - how does your character feel about the other party members (or NPCs)? Create interesting conflict dynamics between the characters in the party. What does your character want from another PC? Why are they not giving it to you? Could your characters want opposite things? As the story goes on, can your characters resolve the conflict, find an agreemend, a win-win outcome?

<!--  (respect, mentorship) -->

<!--   - your character needs something from someone and they're not giving it to you. -->

### Relax and have fun
If you’re feeling stuck and having trouble coming up with ideas - just do whatever seems to make sense at the moment. Often an idea that seems simple and obvious to you will lead to something interesting. Remember, as long as you and others are enjoying the game - you're doing great!

### Make Friends
Get to know peole outside the games. Leave some time for a bit of socializing before or after the games, chat between the games in the text channel.

### Prep things that are hard to improvise
Before the game begins, make sure you have prepared everything that's hard to improvise, but no more.

Listen to players and build off of the ideas they contribute.

Drawa players into the story by asking them to describe killing blows, location details, interesting events during travel.
