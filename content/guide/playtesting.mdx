# Playtesting
After the [brainstorming](https://rpgadventures.io/writers-room) we can do a freeform, improv-heavy, roleplay-focused playtest of our adventure. 

Our goal is to play out a fun story, see the adventure from the perspective of the players, notice any existing issues and open questions, come up with more cool details, ideas, and interesting descriptions. And to practice running the adventure before we do it for our players.

## Before the Game
We can invite the people who haven't played the adventure before, or the authors can playtest it between themselves (if they don't mind knowing the spoilers). We create our characters, one person volunteers to be a GM, and we play through our adventure. 

### Creating your Character
Copy this template, fill it in, post it in `#characters`.
```
**Name**: Character's Name
**Description**: 
Who are you? Appearance, personality, occupation, motivations, relationships.
**Abilities**:
What can you do? Cool powers, special skills, spells, useful items.
```

## During the Game
Since running the first draft of an adventure is hard, during the game all players help the GM by actively contributing to the story, introducing new ideas, and filling in the missing information. If the GM has trouble figuring out what happens next, they can ask other players for suggestions, or even tap out and let someone else continue the story. When necessary, we can pause between the scenes for a quick brainstorm and figure things out together.

If several authors want to try their hand at GMing - we can take turns GMign the scenes.

### Freeform Roleplay
Freeform roleplay doesn’t have other rules - there’s nothing stopping us from doing anything we can imagine, but we trust each other to play fairly - avoid gamebreaking actions, do things that make sense in the story, and try to make it interesting and fun for other players.

### Rolling the Dice
When you attempt a task that is difficult or risky, the GM can tell you to roll a 20-sided die. If your roll is equal to or higher than the target number (set by the GM depending on the difficulty of the task) - you succeed, otherwise you suffer a negative consequence, setback, or a complication.

If you're using an ability or an item relevant to the task you're attempting - roll with advantage (roll two dice, and take the best result). Type `!roll` for a regular roll, type `!adv` to roll with advantage.

## After the Game
After the game we can edit/update the adventure to add new ideas, improvements, and fix the existing issues.
