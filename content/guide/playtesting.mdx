# Playtesting
After the [brainstorming](/writers-room) session we can do a freeform, improv-heavy, roleplay-focused playtest of our adventure. 

Our goal is to play out a fun story, see the adventure from the perspective of the players, notice any existing issues and open questions, come up with more cool ideas, and to practice running the adventure before we do it for our players.

<!-- ## Before the Game
We can invite the people who haven't played the adventure before, or the authors can playtest it between themselves (if they don't mind knowing the spoilers). We create our characters, one person volunteers to be a GM, and we play through our adventure.  -->

### Creating your Character
Copy this template, fill it in, post it in `#characters`.
```
**Name**: Character's Name
**Description**: 
Who are you? Appearance, personality, occupation, motivations, relationships.
**Abilities**:
What can you do? Cool powers, special talents, skills, spells, useful items.
```
<!-- Profession -->

Feel free to use [this list of powers](https://playmirage.io/all-powers) for inspiration.


Example:
> **Name**: Salazar Von Neumann  
> **Description**:  
Former Dark Lord who has lost his powers and memories after being defeated by the pesky band of plucky protagonists. Now undead, he's traveling the world trying to solve the mystery of his past and find the Philosopher's Stone to return to life. His best friend is a charming demon-familiar named Faust.  
> **Abilities**:  
Charismatic, persuasive, excellent liar. Wizard - can use telekinesis, create illusions, send telepathic messages, cast "Charm Person". Has a Cloak of Disguise which allows him to assume an appearance of any humanoid creature up to 4 times per day.

### Rolling the Dice
When you attempt a task that is difficult or risky, the GM can tell you to roll a 20-sided die. If your roll above the target number (set by the GM) - you succeed, otherwise you suffer a negative consequence, setback, or a complication.

The target number depends on the difficulty of the task, situation you're in, and your approach to solving a challenge. GM sets lower numbers for easier tasks and clever solutions, and higher numbers for difficult situations and risky actions.

If you're using an ability or an item relevant to the task you're attempting - roll with **advantage** (roll multiple dice, and take the best result). Roll an extra die for each ability you're using, up to the maximum of 4. Example:
> If you’re trying to really scare someone, and your character is Strong (scary looking), Insightful (can figure out someone's biggest fear), and is holding a Bloody Axe, you can use all 3 to roll 4 dice with advantage.  
<!-- > If you're trying to break into someone's office, and your character is Stealthy, has Lockpicks, and can use Telekinesis (or a trained pet) to open the window from another side, all of those will give you an advantage. -->

Type `!roll` for a regular roll, type `!adv2`, `!adv3`, or `!adv4` to roll multiple dice with advantage.


<!-- 
If you're using an ability or an item relevant to the task you're attempting - roll with advantage (roll two dice and take the best result). 

Type `!roll` in the chat for a regular roll, type `!adv` to roll with advantage.

The target number represents your likelihood of success, it depends on the difficulty of the task, situation you're in, and your approach to solving a challenge. GM sets lower target numbers for easier tasks and clever solutions, and higher numbers for difficult situations and risky actions. If you saw characters in a movie attempt something like this, would you expect it to work?

### Freeform Roleplay
There aren't any other rules. There’s nothing stopping us from doing anything we can imagine, but we trust each other to play well and follow some basic guidelines:

 > \- Do things that make sense and result in a good story, avoid game-breaking actions, play to find out what happens, optimize for fun instead of “winning".  
 \- "Yes, and" - embrace other players' ideas and build on top of them. Don't shut down ideas. Actively help others to have cool moments and achieve their goals, create opportunities for other characters to shine.  
\- Share the Spotlight. Try to make sure that all players have enough opportunities to participate in the story. Avoid talking over other players and dominating the conversation. Help to include the quiet/shy players. If you notice someone being interrupted - ask them what they were about to say.  
\- Advance the Plot. Help the GM to move the story along, be decisive, keep the scenes short, start them as close to the action as possible, end them as soon as the interesting part over.  
\- Actively contribute ideas to the story. Help the GM to establish the scene, point out interesting details in the world around you. Answer unsolved questions, come up with explanations for things that seems inconsistent, fill in the the missing information, help to create a story that makes sense. Assume the responsibility for making the story more fun for yourself and others. Positive energy and enthusiasm are always welcome.

### Collaborative GMing
If several people want to try their hand at GMing - we can take turns GMign the scenes.



<!-- 
If the GM has trouble figuring out what happens next, they can ask other players for suggestions, or even tap out and let someone else continue the story. 
### Take Turns GMing

## During the Game
Since running the first draft of an adventure is hard, during the game all players help the GM by actively contributing to the story, introducing new ideas, and filling in the missing information. If the GM has trouble figuring out what happens next, they can ask other players for suggestions, or even tap out and let someone else continue the story. When necessary, we can pause between the scenes for a quick brainstorm and figure things out together.

### After the Game
After the game we can edit/update the adventure to add new ideas, improvements, and fix the existing issues we discovered during the playtest.
