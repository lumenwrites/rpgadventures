# Adventure Writing Guide

- Use it to write your own adventures, or organize your prep of the published modules.
- Prep what matters, don't prep what doesn't. Spend your energy only on things that enhance the game.
- Clear, attainable goals. Always have a concrete, specific task to accomplish. This removes the confusion and ambiguity about what to do next, which is the main cause of the "writer's block".
- Works well for both low-prep improv-focused GMs, as well as for people who prefer more detailed prep. You start by creating the key information about your adventure, which you can build your improv on top of, and then you expand it into the list of more detailed "Scenes", to the degree that you find necessary.
- Peace of mind. Answering all the questions gives you all the key information you need for a good adventure.
- Works great with "Lazy DM" prep method (including [Secrets and Clues](https://slyflourish.com/sharing_secrets.html)), [Node-Based Scenario Design](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/7949/roleplaying-games/node-based-scenario-design-part-1-the-plotted-approach), and [Island Design Theory](https://gnomestew.com/island-design-theory/). You design the most important parts of an adventure (challenges, NPCs, locations, clues, etc) in a modular way, which allows you to improvise and modify things on the fly during the game in response to the players' choices. Then you assemble these parts into scenes, allowing you to outline the "default" flow of your adventure, how it's intended to be played through. If (when) the players do something unexpected, you can drop the modular parts into your scenes as needed (if the players decide to go to location B instead of the location A, they can meet the NPCs, deal with challenges, or find the clues there instead).

### Tips on using the template in your writing process

- Use the template as a "living document" you incrementally fill in as you come up with new ideas and build your adventure.
- Set deadlines. Aim to complete one stage per day (feel free to go faster, but try not to go slower). Do the best you can within the time-frame that you have. Try to complete the first draft as quickly as possible, create the simplest playable adventure. Then if you have more time - list the most important things you'd like to improve, and focus on them.
- Avoid perfectionism. Answer questions, make creative choices, commit to them, and move on to the next task. Don't try to complete each task perfectly, that slows you down and gets you stuck.
- Go through the steps in order. Each part of the template asks you a question, and writing an adventure is the matter of answering them one by one.
- Make lists. To answer a question, quickly list 5 possible answers you can think of, and pick your favorite one. Don't try to come up with the best answers right away - aim for "good enough". If it's not great - that's okay, use it as a placeholder, improve it later, after the first draft is complete.
- Blank Page vs Lego Blocks. Don't try to invent everything from scratch. Instead of staring at the blank page and trying to make something up - take parts from your favorite movies, TV shows, books, or games, and assemble the adventure out of them, using them as lego blocks. If you're struggling with a question (a story idea, a character, a location, etc) - don't hesitate to take an answer from a book or a movie. You can use it as a placeholder to tweak and replace later, you can combine multiple ideas to make something new, or you can use one with minimal changes. You can even just take a TV episode or a published adventure, mine it for ideas and answers, and use this process to adapt it to your game.
- Use the Reddit's hivemind. If you get stuck - make a post on /r/DMAcademy or /r/DnDAdventureWriter and ask for help with brainstorming ideas or answering questions.

# Elements of an Adventure

This is the complete list of things you need to figure out to create an adventure and run the game.

## Adventure Idea
### Exciting Premise

What is the main “High Concept” idea for this adventure? What makes it exciting?

The problem your characters are facing should be promising to take them on a cool journey, to put them in entertaining, thrilling, unlikely, fantastical situations.

### Problem/Goal
What problem will the players need to solve, what goal will they strive to achieve? What Evil Plan does the Villain have that the heroes will be trying to prevent?

Stories are about problem solving. The idea for your adventure is the main problem your players will be trying to solve throughout the game, the main goal they will need to pursue. Resolving it will be the single most important event that will determine whether the characters succeed or fail, the thing the "final battle" revolves around.

The process of trying to solve the problem should be fun and compelling:

- **High Stakes**  
Your players and their characters need to have a meaningful reason to care about solving the problem. It should be very valuable or important, to them personally or to the world they live in. What will happen if the heroes fail?
- **Challenging**  
Easy things are boring to do. There should be a reason why the problem wasn’t solved before, why it takes a group of heroes to tackle it. Solving the problem should push the characters to their limits, demand inventiveness and creativity. What makes it difficult to accomplish? What complications may arise?

## Challenges and Obstacles
What steps do the players need to take to accomplish the goal? What obstacles/complications will they need to overcome? What are the possible solutions to these problems? What "moves" will the Villain make to make life more difficult for the players?

As your players struggle to achieve their main goal, they will encounter obstacles, which will be interesting and rewarding to overcome. Challenges should be exciting, difficult, and necessary to overcome in order to solve the problem. Pick 3-5 challenges, gradually escalating the difficulty, stakes, importance, commitment, and threats. The first task is the easiest one, getting the players to engage with adventure. The last challenge is the most difficult and climactic of all, it will determine whether the heroes succeed or fail at their mission.

## Characters
Who are the most important NPCs? Main Antagonist, Minions/Monsters, Quest Giver, Friendly/Neutral NPCs.

**The Antagonist**
- What is their goal? Why do they pursue it? What horrible thing will happen if they succeed?
- What are the steps of their evil plan? How would it unfold if it was unopposed by the players?
- How will the players learn about the plan, and what could they do to disrupt and ultimately ruin it? How will the villain respond to these disruptions?
- What resources do they have to accomplish their goal, fight back against players, and get their plan back on track?

**Quest Giver and Friendly/Neutral NPCs**

They can introduce the players to the quest, help them, provide valuable information or exposition, create roleplaying opportunities. They can also trade with players and teach them abilities.

For each character:
- Description (Appearance, Mannerisms, Speech).
- Personality (Values, Ideals, Flaws, Opinions, Likes).
- Goals and Motivations (Desires, Fears, Passions).

Optional:
- Relationships (Allies, Enemies, Factions, Social Status).
- Talking points for the dialogue. Secrets they know, information they need to convey to players.
- What will they do to help players out or to set them back?
- Unique Powers/Spells/Items.
- TV/Movie character they’re similar to.
- Illustration.

## Setting
You will need to create an exciting and fascinating world for the players to play in, cool places for them to visit and explore. You will need to know how the world looks visually, what are its social/cultural norms, what does daily life look like.

- Where does the adventure take place?
- What are the 3 most interesting/unusual things about this region? [Local/global. History, culture, politics, religion, trade, technology, magic, nature, daily life. Who's in power? People’s problems, hopes, fears?]
- What important events have happened before the players arrived? What is the situation that caused the problem players are trying to solve?

### Locations

Where does the adventure begin? To what interesting or important areas might the adventure lead? Where will the most important scenes take place? What will be the awesome set piece for the climax of the story?

For each location:

- Short description. What makes this place awesome and unique? What are some notable, interesting, important things in this location?
- What dangers/obstacles does the location present?
- What opportunities will PCs see to use their powers? How can they use the environment/objects in a fight?

## Story Clues/Secrets
What key pieces of information do the players need to know to be able to make progress towards their goal, figure out what's going on, and complete their quest? What clues will they need to find to be able to discover this information? Where will these clues lead them? What scenes (locations/encounters/conversations) do they unlock?

For each clue:
- Description of the clue.
- What does it tell the players about the story?
- To what scenes does this clue lead? What tasks does it give them to accomplish? What action does it encourage them to take?

# Structure of an Adventure

### Campaign Structure
Individual quests will work well for one-shot games, played in one or few sessions. A longer campaign is a series of quests, think of them as episodes of a TV show. Chain the three (or more) quests together, to reflect the different stages of a single epic adventure, each one moving the players closer to achieving their overarching goal.

> “Find the map to the magic sword” > “Retrieve the sword” > “Use it to slay the Dragon”

### Scenes
A short outline of the adventure, a list of the key scenes that are likely to happen. Each quest consists of several challenges, and each challenge is made out of several scenes that the players will play out in their effort to achieve their goal.

- **Setup**  
The opening scene, exposition. Where do the players begin the adventure?
- **Adventure Hook**  
The first scene that draws players into action, and gives them the first set of tasks to accomplish.
How do the players encounter the problem and realize that it needs to be solved?
How can you make the players and their characters care about solving the problem?
What are the first set of tasks the plaeyrs need to accomplish?
- **Escalating Challenges**  
A series of 3-5 obstacles/complications characters overcome as they strive towards the goal. Milestones that take them from where they are to where they want to be. A rollercoaster of victories and setbacks. Raise the stakes and threat level.
- **Climax**  
The last, the biggest, the most important, and the most dangerous challenge. “The final battle”. It will ultimately determine whether the players succeed or fail. The outcome will significantly change their lives or the world.
- **Resolution**  
Possible outcomes/consequences of the adventure.
How does the world (and character’s lives) change after the final battle?
How the secondary plot threads might resolve?
What rewards will the players receive?
- **Other potentially awesome/important scenes**  
Important locations they will visit, important NPCs interactions, cool action scenes, events they will witness.

**Scene Template**
- Location - where does it take place?
- NPCs - who will the players encounter there?
- Challenges - what obstacles will they need to overcome?
- Story Clues - what will the players learn about the story? To what other scenes do these clues lead?
- Events - what things will happen that are outside of the players’ control?
- Action and Conflict (Desire+Obstacle) - What do the players want, and what stands in their way? What complication will arise? What difficult decision do they need to make?
- Change of Value - How will the scene take them closer to or fartehr away from their goal? How does this scene move the story forward?

## Other Elements

- **Illustrations and Maps**  
Pretty pictures to make the adventure more interactive and fun.
- **Stat Blocks**  
Mechanical elements of the adventure, encounter design.
- **Items**  
Treasure/reward items, merchants’ inventory, loot enemies will drop, notable/cool/story-relevant objects PCs will find.

## Adventure Genres

- For **mystery** adventures, focus on clues. Instead of giving information to the players right away, hide it behind the clues. Clues are pieces of information that encourage players to take action, give them tasks to accomplish, lead the players from scene to scene, guiding them through the plot of the adventure. From the initial question (who done it? what's going on here?) to the solution. Think of the scenes as the "rooms" in a dungeon, and clues as the keys unlocking the doors between them. Players complete the challenges inside the scenes/rooms, which allows them to find clues to unlock more scenes. Create 3 clues for each conclusion players need to reach (the "door" leading to the next scene).
- For **heist** adventures, focus on creating interesting environmental and stealth challenges (use the list of challenge prompts for ideas). Think about the challenges as the plan stages the players need to go through to commit the heist, and figure out what can make them difficult, which complications may arise.
- For **intrigue** adventures, focus on the NPCs/factions, their goals and relationships, and use the social challenges (from the list of prompts).
- Mix **multiple genres** for variety. Instead of writing a convoluted mystery or an elaborate heist, create adventures combining simple challenges from mystery/investigation, stealth/heist, social/intrigue, exploration, and action/adventure genres. This provides more variety, and is easier to write as well (a big mystery/heist adventure can get complicated, but a small mystery/heist challenge or a scene is fun and easy to make).
