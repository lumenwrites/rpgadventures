# High Concept Adventure Ideas
<span className="small">(see more prompts in <Link to="/prompts">Prompts App</Link>)</span>

"High Concept" ideas are creative premises, interesting "What if?" scenarios. They will put your players into fantastical and unusual situations. You can use them as a starting point for your adventure - pick a High Concept idea, and see which interesting problems/goals it can generate, or just combine it with one of the <Link to="/prompts/goals">goals</Link>.

Ways to make the ideas more original:

- **Combine multiple ideas**.  
Legolas with the personality of Spider Man, John Snow with the personality of Jack Sparrow. Hogwarts + Xavier College for Superheroes. Jurassic Park + Honey I Shrunk The Kids = Anatomy Park.
- **Change the genre**.  
From Sci Fi to Fantasy or from Horror to Comedy.  Fantasy Futurama episode, serious Gravity Falls episode, lighthearted Game of Thrones.
- **Reverse one of the important aspects of the idea**   
Tell the story from the perspective of the antagonist, where evil guys are good and vice versa. Switch the character's gender or an important personality trait. Female Tony Stark, evil Hermione, cheerful Batman.
