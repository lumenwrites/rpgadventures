# Blood of the Hunter

## Summary
Die Hard in Hogwarts. The Academy of Arcane Arts and Adventures has been taken over by the group of vampires. They seek Valery McClane, the daughter of the Vampire Hunter. Her father has cursed the vampire clan, turning them mortal, and only drinking her blood can undo the curse. The vampires have tricked a student into disabling the school’s defenses, opened the portal into the Main Hall, mind-controlled the teachers, and are now searching for Valery, and taking the students through the portal into the clan’s lair - the dark tower. The players will need to infiltrate the castle taken over by the vampires, awaken the security djinn to protect the students, and then pursue the vampires through the portal to rescue the kidnapped ones.

# Scenes

## Receiving the Letter
The heroes begin in the old and grimey tavern ("Toadshead") in the Northwick - a small magical village close to the Adventuring Academy (basically Hogsmeade). 

They can see the castle of the Adventuring Academy out of the window, in the distance, and soon they notice that the protective barrier around the school (like a soap bubble surrounding the castle ) has disappeared at some point.

Soon an exhausted and beaten up looking owl smashes through the window, carrying a letter to the bartender. The letter is bloodstained and written in a rushed handwriting:

> “The school is under attack. Send help. Northen tower.”

## Traveling to the Academy
There are stables with griffons next to the tavern. There's also a secret passage between the tavern and the school.

The griffons can deliver the players straight to the Northen tower, but can be noticed from the school's windows.

## The Owlery
The Northern Tower is the Owlery for postal owls. Inside it the players will find Valery McClane, a young student of the academy who sent the letter. She looks injured, and is trying to hold the door. Something strong is smashing through it, trying to get it to open.
