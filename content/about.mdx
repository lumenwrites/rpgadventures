# About

This is a collection of adventures created by the Adventure Writer's Room community.

We meet in the discord voice chat, and challenge ourselves to improvise a one-shot adventure in 2 hours. We do this by filling in the [brainstorming template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nGwOkRbI80hz8O51-S1R081a1Em98bWg9dj6_zQ2NMY/) together, one step at a time. Our goal is to brainstorm fun ideas and improvise stories together in a chill, lighthearted, no-pressure environment. It works, it really helps with writing, and it is super fun. We're looking for some friendly and creative people to join us!

If you want to improvise some stories, or need some help with the writing - come join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/UVNxeQE)!

Novice GMs are welcome! I'm a novice GM, and I've made the group because I thought that making adventures together would be helpful, and make the process easier and more fun. There are no prerequisites, no expectations about being a brilliant writer or improviser. If you're friendly and are interested in stretching your creative muscles - you're welcome!

Experienced GMs are also welcome, we have quite a few very experienced folks who are really good at what they do, and it helps a lot.

If you're a player with no GMing experience and this sounds like fun - come join us as well!
