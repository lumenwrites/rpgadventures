# About

This is a collection of adventures created by the Adventure Writer's Room community.

We are a group of GMs who meet in the discord voice chat, and challenge ourselves to improvise a one-shot adventure in 2 hours. Our goal is to brainstorm fun ideas and improvise stories together in a chill, lighthearted, no-pressure environment. It works, it really helps with creating adventures, and it is super fun. Read more about our brainstorming process [here](/brainstorming).

We're looking for some friendly and creative people to join us! If you want to improvise some stories, stretch your creative muscles, get help writing your adventures, or just have some fun brainstorming ideas - come join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/UVNxeQE)!

Novice people are welcome! There are no prerequisites, no expectations about being a brilliant writer or improviser.  Experienced GMs are also welcome, we have quite a few very experienced folks who are really good at what they do, and it helps a lot. If you're a player with no GMing experience and this sounds like fun - come join us as well!
