title: Pirates and Parrots
date: 2020-06-04
description: Players are Pirates of the Floating Islands, and their home, Fera Ley (think Tortuga but in the air) is being attacked by a massive flying ship of the Royal Navy, sent to “bring order and civilization to Fera Ley and put the pirate problem to rest”. The Dread Pirate Mont Blanc was just defeated in battle, and now the players are Fera Ley’s last hope to keep her freedom.
