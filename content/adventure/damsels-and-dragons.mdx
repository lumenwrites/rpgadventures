## Scenes
### Meet the Dragon
You walk down a narrow road through the shady forest, it’s quite quiet and peaceful. You have been traveling together for a few days (it’s safer to travel together, not to mention more fun), passing the fields, rivers, and small villages.  During this time you got to know your fellow travelers a little. What would they have learned about you? 
(introduce your character)


In the distance, you hear a roar, and then again - a little louder this time. It seems to be coming from the direction you’re headed.

Ahead of you, you see a few sun rays breaking through the trees - a clearing. The roars are coming from that direction. Raaaawwwwrrrr!!! 

Then maybe a howl.

comes to the edge of the clearing. In the middle of it - holy pony, is that a dragon? Certainly looks like one - bronze skin, scales, wings - all there. Not a large one though, about the size of an elephant, it seems to be very young. It has curled up in the middle of a clearing.  It notices you, slowly lifts his head, and howls. Strangely sad, heartwrenching sound. Is it crying?

It has noticed you, it looks in your direction and emits a sad howl.

scurries to hide behind a tree (not very successfully, you can still see 90% of the dragon behind the thin tree).

"They took my mama! The bad people!"
"They took her away! I'm all alone now."

"The warriors! In black armor, with big swords and spikes! She fought so hard to protect us, but attacked her, and cast spells on her, and, and, and they captured her! And chained her, and put her in a cage, and took her away!"

The dragon looks at your faces, clearly confused. "You're so nice! My name is Kimba. My mom's name is Malinda. She's really kind and brave and strong! She's the best dragon."
He perks up when he hears the invitation. "I can help!  It's scary, but I can be brave! Like mama!"

then again, closer this time. You realize that it’s coming not from the forest, but from the sky.
Small dragon. Sad roar. Looks like it’s crying.


 Find the castle
Kimba doesn’t know where they took her, only the direction. Let him help if the players want that.
See the Bugbear in a cage carried to the castle.
Liberate Gladiators
Gladiator’s wife crying punching the guard.
Get into the pits under the coliseum, distract the guards, free prisoners.
Enter the Coliseum
The spectacle is just for the nobles.
Disable the Force Field
Distract Alatar or destroy the energy crystal
Mage can release monsters to cause mayhem (if that makes sense). Guards will attack if they’re not distracted.
Talk down Malinda
Malinda is enraged, confused, shooting fire breath in random directions. Wants to murder everyone on the stands(mention there are kids there). Convince her not to slaughter the people.

Malinda is forced to fight Remorhaz, and once the field is off, it’ll attack the crowd (mention that there are kids there).
Deal with the guards
Free the Dragon
Break her chains and fly away on her.
