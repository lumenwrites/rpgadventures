## Scenes

### Entering the Village
You’re walking down a narrow road towards the Clearwater village. You’ve heard that people there need some help with a few chores, and figured that it sounds like a quiet and peaceful place to rest between the adventures while making a bit of money. You have been traveling together for a few days (it’s safer to travel together, not to mention more fun), passing the fields, rivers, and other small villages. During this time you got to know your fellow travelers a little. What would they have learned about you? 
(introduce your character)

As you walk closer to the houses, you see an old man waving at you, he’s wearing 
Hey fellas! What brings you to Clearwater?
Everyone calls me Old Man McGucket, how can I help cha?

You  walk into a beautiful happy village, everybody is nice and welcoming. One unusual thing you notice is that all people here really love colorful hats - top-hats, cowboy hats, fedoras, etc. Players see one person, without a hat, running away, but the guards quickly apprehend him, claiming he's a murderer.

Tavern
Welcome, welcome weary travelers! 
The food is bland, it doesn’t seem to have any salt.

You see some sort of commotion from the window. You see a man running away from two guards “Hey, get him!”  by the time you’re outside, you see them carrying him, unconscious, back in the direction of the 

Where do 
If players capture a person and remove the hat, they see a green slug underneath it. If they remove the slug, the person falls on the floor and starts crying, thanking them for his freedom. It is revealed that everyone in the village is controlled by psychic brain-slugs, attached to their heads, wearing hats as a disguise(ratatouille-style). Players can also be ambushed by a group of villagers trying to assimilate them.

Gradually it becomes clear that things aren't so black and white - the slug hive-mind (calling itself Harmony) is trying to "bring peace and joy to all the living creatures", to build a utopia. Turning murderers and alcoholics into productive members of society, curing the depression of a suicidal person(by controlling their thoughts), etc.

Players need to find the location of the center of the hive-mind. They descend into the waterless well, find a bunch of tunnels, mind-controlled giant spiders and centepedes, and a vast underground lake glowing with eerie emerald green color - the coalescion of brain-slugs, the main hive-mind. They will need to destroy it (or convince it to leave, like in The World's End, or find a path to symbiosis).
